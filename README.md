## Description

**Sudoku** (/soo·’dow·koo, -’dok-, suh-/; Japanese: 数独 lit. "single digit") is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
